# Byteconf

ðŸ‘‹ This is the source code for [byteconf.com](https://www.byteconf.com)!

Byteconf is a developer community for everyone. We build free developer conferences and stream them online, like [Byteconf React](https://www.byteconf.com/react-2018)!

This website is the landing page for all of our events, and an increasing number of additional things like [blog posts](https://www.byteconf.com/blog) and all kinds of other things.

The tech stack:
- The site is built with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)
- Event, speaker, and talk data is sourced from our [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io) instance. Our Sanity.io schema is open-source, [check it out](https://github.com/byteconf/byteconf-sanity-schema)!
- Blog posts are sourced from our [Ghost](https://ghost.org) instance. [Interested in contributing?](https://www.byteconf.com/blog/accepting-story-submissions)
- The site is deployed hourly using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)!

We're interested in contributions, but we're still trying to figure out how to do that well! More to come soon ðŸ‘€
